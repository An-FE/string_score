A port of the Quicksilver string ranking algorithm.  Including the qs_score.js file will extend the javascript string object to include the score option.

Examples:
"hello world".score("axl") //=> 0
"hello world".score("ow") //=> 0.6
"hello world".score("hello world") //=> 1

Tested & working in:
Firefox 2 & 3
Safari 3 & 4
IE: 7 & 8
Chrome: 1 & 2
Opera: 


Notes:
qs_score.js does not have any external dependencies._

The tests located in the tests folder relies the files located in the tests folder.
