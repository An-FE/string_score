This javascript will score a string against another string. It began as a rewrite of A port of the Quicksilver string ranking algorithm (quicksilver.js aka qs_score.js).  The final product only contains a few characters from the original algorithm

Examples: (results are for example only... I may change the scoring algorithm without updating examples)
========
"hello world".score("axl") //=> 0
"hello world".score("ow")  //=> 0.18181818181818182 

"hello world".score("h")           //=>0.09090909090909091
"hello world".score("he")          //=>0.18181818181818182
"hello world".score("hel")         //=>0.2727272727272727
"hello world".score("hell")        //=>0.36363636363636365
"hello world".score("hello")       //=>0.45454545454545453
...
"hello world".score("helloworld")  //=>0.90909090909090913
"hello world".score("hello worl")  //=>0.9090909090909091
"hello world".score("hello world") //=> 1

'Hello'.score('h') //=>0.13999999999999999
'He'.score('h')    //=>0.35

// Same case matches better then wrong case
'Hello'.score('h') //=>0.13999999999999999
'Hello'.score('H') //=>0.2


Benchmarks & Tested Browsers
============================
Tested & working in:                 Ranking (Based upon benchmarks when from tests/index.html QUnit test)
Firefox 3 & 3.5beta (Mac & Windows)  Third Fastest (3.5beta) **
Safari 4 (Mac & Windows)             Second Fastest!
IE: 7 (Windows)                      Last Fastest
Chrome: 2 (Windows)                  Fastest
Opera: 9.64 (Windows)                Fourth Fastest
** firefox 3.0.10 on windows failed (stop script message) under 5000 iterations of 446 character string scored by a 70 character string. All other browsers tested survived this test, and in fact survive a larger number of iterations.


Notes
=====
string_score.js does not have any external dependencies other then a reasonably new browser.

The tests located in the tests folder relies the files located in the tests folder.

Please share your testing results with me if you are able to test under an unlisted browser.
