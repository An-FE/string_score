NOTICE
======
This string score plugin, although stable & safe may not give desirable results.
For the moment, although this is much faster then (quicksilver.js aka qs_score.js), quicksilver.js or liquidmetal would probably suite your needs better.  In the next few days I hope to complete this plugin, at which point I will remove this notice!

Example of current issue:
"Hillsdale".score("hi") is lower then "Chippewa".score("hi") but shouldn't be!  This is due to having a higher percentage of matched characters and will be solved by weighting certain types of matches.



This is a rewrite of A port of the Quicksilver string ranking algorithm.  
Special thanks to 'Lachie Cox' for inspiration

Examples
========
"hello world".score("axl") //=> 0
"hello world".score("ow")  //=> 0.18181818181818182 

"hello world".score("h")           //=>0.09090909090909091
"hello world".score("he")          //=>0.18181818181818182
"hello world".score("hel")         //=>0.2727272727272727
"hello world".score("hell")        //=>0.36363636363636365
"hello world".score("hello")       //=>0.45454545454545453
...
"hello world".score("helloworld")  //=>0.90909090909090913
"hello world".score("hello worl")  //=>0.9090909090909091
"hello world".score("hello world") //=> 1

'Hello'.score('h') //=>0.13999999999999999
'He'.score('h')    //=>0.35

// Same case matches better then wrong case
'Hello'.score('h') //=>0.13999999999999999
'Hello'.score('H') //=>0.2
